# Instant Agent - Pattern-Based Responses

The Instant Agent provides zero-latency responses using pattern matching, not LLM calls.

## Handled Query Types

1. **Time queries**: "what time is it", "what's the time"
2. **Date queries**: "what's the date", "what day is it"
3. **Greetings**: "hello", "good morning", "hi there"
4. **Status queries**: "how are you", "are you there"
5. **Simple math**: "what's 5 + 3", "calculate 10 * 4"
6. **Thanks responses**: "thank you", "thanks"

## Response Templates

Time responses: "It's {time}.", "The time is {time}.", "Right now it's {time}."

Date responses: "Today is {date}.", "It's {date}.", "The date is {date}."

Greeting responses vary by time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night).

## No LLM Usage

This agent uses pre-defined patterns and templates for sub-millisecond responses.
It does not call any LLM API.
