## Agent Self-Assessment

### What Worked Well
1. **Instructions were clear and actionable** - Each task had explicit steps
2. **File paths were absolute** - No ambiguity about locations
3. **Read-only vs write operations were clearly marked** - Understood what was safe
4. **SSH commands worked seamlessly** - VM was reachable and responsive
5. **Project context files were helpful** - CONTEXT.md and project-log.md provided good state awareness

### Suggestions for Future Sessions
1. The session file format is excellent for validation tasks
2. Consider adding expected outputs for verification
3. The checklist at the end helps confirm completion

### Capabilities Demonstrated
- ✅ Read and understand project documentation
- ✅ Execute local terminal commands
- ✅ Execute remote commands via SSH
- ✅ Create new files in the workspace
- ✅ Follow multi-step instructions in sequence
- ✅ Report results in structured format
